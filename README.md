# Learning Java with Projects

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Core%20Java-Bootcamp-blue)


Programming is like riding a bike; you can read about how to do it all day, but the best way to get started is to practice.

Java is a great first programming language because it has a broad feature set and is used in a variety of applications, including desktop applications, Android apps, and iOS app development. Java is also in high demand, with [40 percent of respondents in Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies) claiming to use the language.

Learning to code in Java can help you get started in a variety of applicable fields, as depicted in the picture. Many of these opportunities are both lucrative and promising in their long-term job security. For example, software developers are projected to see 22 percent job growth by 2029, which is much higher than the average job growth projected for most fields.


## Yet another bootcamp

One great way to seize this opportunity is to enroll in a **coding bootcamp**. This can provide you with a broad set of coding-related skills in a relatively short time frame, offering an introduction to crucial skills through hands-on, project-based learning. Bootcamps are also accessible to a variety of prior experience levels — everyone from career upskillers to complete beginners.

When learning to code, it's important to have help available when you need it. We therefore pick an excellent and very experienced corporate instructor for learning Core Java while simultaneously honing our time management and accountability skills.

## Before getting started

Now, before we immerse ourselves into writing code here's a few things you should know about Java:
**Java is a portable, secure, robust, compiled, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language.** This means it can run on any machine, regardless of what operating system is used.

### Java Virtual Machine
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is our smallest unit. When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).

### Java Runtime Environment
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides Java class libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components that are required to run Java applications. If you need to run Java programs, but not develop them, JRE is what you need.

### Java Development Kit
JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It refers to all the standard libraries used in programming the software and a number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger, etc). When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.

## Projects

For our projects we need [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) and once this is in your system, we'll need an editor, [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

The projects in our list are weekly assignments focusing on different skills in **Core Java** needed to build out a well-rounded Java skill set; progressing in difficulty as the list continues.

2. [Looping](https://github.com/ajitagupta/core-java-projects/blob/main/Employee.java)
3. [Arrays and Strings](https://github.com/ajitagupta/core-java-projects/blob/main/VowelsConsonants.java)

## 1. Introduction
In our first two classes we cover the concepts class, data types, Wrapper classes, variable types (static, local, instance), arithmetics, and the Scanner class.

`Book.java` is the corresponding assignment. 

Here, we create a `Book` class, which asks the user for three inputs: `book name, author name, publish status`, and then prints those values sequentially to the console.

## 2. Looping

Looping consists of a) decision-making constructs (if, ladder if else, switch) since they make logical decisions (true/false) based on the conditions provided, and b) conditional statements, which are the executable block of code (or branch to a specific code) dependent on certain conditions (while, do_while, for).

`Employee.java` is the corresponding assignment. 

Here, the user is supposed to enter his name, daily salary, and number of office attending-days that month. His monthly salary is calculated and used to justify to him his job designation.

## 3. Arrays and Strings

In this class we tackle a common interview question: Counting the number of vowels and consonants in a string array specified by the user.

`VowelsConsonants.java` contains the solution and here is a demo output:
