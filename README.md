# Learning Java with Projects

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-Bootcamp-blue)


Programming is like riding a bike; you can read about how to do it all day, but the best way to get started is to practice.

Java is a great first programming language because it has a broad feature set and is used in a variety of applications, including desktop applications, Android apps, and iOS app development. Java is also in high demand, with [40 percent of respondents in Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies) claiming to use the language.

Learning to code in Java can help you get started in a variety of applicable fields, such as engineering and web development. Many of these opportunities are both lucrative and promising in their long-term job security. For example, software developers are projected to see 22 percent job growth by 2029, which is much higher than the average job growth projected for most fields.

One great way to seize this opportunity is to enroll in a coding bootcamp. This can provide you with a broad set of coding-related skills in a relatively short time frame, offering an introduction to crucial skills through hands-on, project-based learning. Bootcamps are also accessible to a variety of prior experience levels — everyone from career upskillers to complete beginners. When learning to code, it's important to have help available when you need it. We therefore pick an excellent and experienced instructor for learning Java coding while simultaneously honing our time management and accountability skills.

The projects in our list focus on different skills needed to build out a well-rounded Java skill set; progressing in difficulty as the list continues.
